Description
===========
This is project Style Transfer developed by team NST composed of Yonghong Liu, Xiaotao Guo

Code organization
=================
- [demo.ipynb](demo.ipynb) -- Run a demo of our code (reproduces Figure 11 - 12 of our report)
- [realtime_style_transfer.ipynb](realtime_style_transfer.ipynb) -- Run the training of real-time style transfer (as described in Section 2)
- [Experiment_classic_style_transfer.ipynb](Experiment_classic_style_transfer.ipynb) -- Run the experiment of classic style transfer (reproduces Figure 2 - 5 of our report)
- [Experiment_realtime_style_transfer.ipynb](Experiment_realtime_style_transfer.ipynb) -- Run the experiment of real-time style transfer (reproduces Figure 6 - 9 of our report)
- [Cross_experiments.ipynb](Cross_experiments.ipynb) -- Run the experiment of comparison between two versions of style transfer (reproduces Figure 10 of our report)
- [original_NST.py](original_NST.py) -- Module for implementing classic style transfer (as described in Section 2)
